The RecieveData code is meant to recieve packets of electrode/encoder values from the TeensyLC. 
  Code is a python script that connects to the TeensyLC via Serial port. It then continuously recieves the packets being sent by the TeensyLC and stores them into a queue.
  
For a given version x_y_z, versionning should be done in the following manner : 
  - If a bugfix is made, z increments.
  - If a feature is added, y increments.
  - If the core logic of the code is changed (ie. transferring to real-time acquisition), x increments.
  
Every change should be documented in the original commit AND on the google doc corresponding to the code you've worked on.
This ensures that students can understand correctly your code and keep working on it efficiently.
